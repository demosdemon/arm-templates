============

A few simple rules for the road.

1. Before opening a PR with a significant change, open an issue so we can discuss design issues. Significant = behavior or API change
2. New functionality must have tests, and they must pass.
3. Play nice. This is a community fork, i.e. not a Microsoft-offical project. In other words, I'm doing this in my free time.
